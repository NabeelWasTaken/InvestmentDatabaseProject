**Why is this project interest to me?**

I have always been interested in Finance and Investing, 
but I never got a chance to invest since 
I did not have a lot of knowledge about it.
 Now that I am working on this application it would provide me 
with a ton of insights into this field and hopefully make this project more interesting and etc.
